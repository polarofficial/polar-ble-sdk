/// Offline recording API.
///
/// Offline recording makes it possible to record `PolarBleApi.PolarDeviceDataType` data to device memory.
/// With Offline recording the Polar device and phone don't need to be connected all the time, as offline recording continues in Polar device even the BLE disconnects.
///
///  Offline records saved into the device can be encrypted. The  `PolarRecordingSecret` is provided for
///  `startOfflineRecording` and `setOfflineRecordingTrigger` when encryption is wanted.
///  The `PolarRecordingSecret` with same key must be provided in `getOfflineRecord` to correctly
///  decrypt the data in the device.
///
/// Requires feature `PolarBleSdkFeature.feature_polar_offline_recording`
///
/// Note, offline recording is supported in Polar Verity Sense device (starting from firmware version 2.1.0)
///

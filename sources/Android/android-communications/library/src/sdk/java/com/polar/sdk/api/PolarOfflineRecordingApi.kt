/**
 * Offline recording API.
 *
 * Offline recording makes it possible to record [PolarBleApi.PolarDeviceDataType] data to device memory.
 * With Offline recording the Polar device and phone don't need to be connected all the time, as offline recording
 * continues in Polar device even the BLE disconnects.
 *
 * Offline records saved into the device can be encrypted. The [PolarRecordingSecret] is provided for
 * [startOfflineRecording] and [setOfflineRecordingTrigger] when encryption is wanted. The [PolarRecordingSecret] with same key must be provided
 * in [getOfflineRecord] to correctly decrypt the data in the device.
 *
 * Requires features [FEATURE_POLAR_OFFLINE_RECORDING]
 *
 * Note, offline recording is supported in Polar Verity Sense device (starting from firmware version 2.1.0)
